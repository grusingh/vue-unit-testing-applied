### Quick refresher on unit testing
> In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

In VueJs world the units that we test are:
